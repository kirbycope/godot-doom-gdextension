# PureDoom

A GDExtension that runs the real DOOM engine inside Godot 4.8 and shows it on a `TextureRect`. The engine
is [PureDOOM](https://github.com/Daivuk/PureDOOM), a single-header C port of the 1993 source with no OS
layer of its own; this addon supplies its time, file, print and environment callbacks, copies its 320x200
frame into an `ImageTexture` every tick, feeds its 11025 Hz sound into an `AudioStreamGenerator`, and turns
Godot input events into DOOM key, button and mouse events. Everything runs in-process, so the same source
builds for the Windows desktop and for the browser as a WebAssembly side module.

## Demo scene

`scenes/demo/demo.tscn` runs the node full screen with the controls card down each side and, when Godot MIDI
Player (`addons/midi/`) is in the project, the music through `assets/gzdoom.sf2`. It is the main scene of the
[Godot Doom GDExtension](https://github.com/kirbycope/godot-doom-gdextension) project this addon is developed
in, and it is also the shortest example of wiring the node up: instantiate it, connect `exited`, connect
`midi_message` to a synthesiser, call `start()`. Where the library is not built for the platform the demo
shows a message instead of failing.

It also shows the two things a host scene has to handle itself. DOOM turns on relative mouse motion, so the
demo captures the cursor in `_ready()`, gives it back on Escape and takes it again on a click. And because a
browser only grants pointer lock from inside a user gesture, a web export cannot capture at startup at all;
the demo puts a "Click to start" `CanvasLayer` up when `OS.has_feature("web")` and captures on that first
click. Off the web the interstitial stays hidden.

## Using the node

Add a `PureDoom` node (it is a `TextureRect`) anywhere a `Control` can go, typically inside a `SubViewport`
whose texture ends up on a screen mesh. Then:

```gdscript
var doom: Control = ClassDB.instantiate(&"PureDoom")
add_child(doom)
doom.call(&"start") # Boots the shareware WAD straight into E1M1
doom.call(&"stop")  # Freezes the game where it is; start() resumes it
```

`ClassDB.class_exists(&"PureDoom")` tells you whether the library is built for the running platform, so a
scene can fall back to something else where it is not (the demo world falls back to a GDScript raycaster).

| Property | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `wad_path` | The IWAD to load; defaults to the shareware `assets/doom1.wad`. A registered `doom.wad` works too. |
| `mouse_sensitivity` | Mouse pixels to DOOM turn units. |
| `skill` | 1 to 5, the `-skill` the level starts on. |

The `exited` signal fires with DOOM's exit code if the engine quits or errors. The `midi_message` signal
carries the music: DOOM's sequencer runs at 140 Hz and every message comes out as an `InputEventMIDI`,
ready for a synthesiser. With [Godot MIDI Player](https://bitbucket.org/arlez80/godot-midi-player-g4) and a
SoundFont that is one line:

```gdscript
doom.midi_message.connect(midi_player.receive_raw_midi_message)
```

Controls: WASD walks and strafes, the mouse turns, left click and Ctrl fire, Space uses, Shift runs, Tab is
the automap, 1 to 7 pick weapons, backquote (`) opens DOOM's menu (Enter picks, backquote closes), and the
letters stay themselves so the cheat codes can be typed. On a pad the left stick walks and strafes, the right
stick turns (it presses DOOM's left and right arrows, so Y for run applies), RT and X fire, A uses, Y runs,
B accepts, Back opens the menu, and the d-pad is context-sensitive: with the menu up it is the arrow keys,
in the game up is the automap, down is the menu, and left and right cycle to the previous or next weapon you
own (`cycle_weapon` reads the engine's weapon list, presses the slot's number and lets go two tics later).
`is_menu_open()`, `is_automap_open()` and `get_weapon_slot()` expose the same engine state. The level starts directly (`-warp 1 1`)
because Escape and Start are left to the host scene; after dying, use restarts the level.

## Controls card

`scenes/pure_doom_controls_overlay.tscn` is a `CanvasLayer` that prints the controls in plain text down each
side of the screen, a movement column on the left and an actions column on the right, so a scene that fills
the middle with the monitor has the black bands documented. What it prints comes from
`resources/controls.tres`, a `PureDoomControls` resource: two lists of `PureDoomControl` lines, each with the
DOOM action's name and the input for it written out for `keyboard`, `xbox`, `nintendo` and `playstation`.
Set the overlay's `input_type` to one of those (or `touch`, which shows the Xbox wording) from whatever
detects the device, and lines with no text for that device are dropped, so the weapon slots and the strafe
modifier only appear on the keyboard. The card describes the mapping in `pure_doom.cpp`; editing the `.tres`
changes the wording, not the mapping.

Config and save files go to `user://pure_doom/`. PureDOOM keeps one global engine, so only one `PureDoom`
node can run in a process and it initialises once; `stop()` and `start()` pause and resume it.

## Building

Prebuilt binaries for Windows, macOS and the web are in `bin/`. To rebuild, clone godot-cpp into this folder (it is git-ignored) and dump
the extension API from the Godot build you run, so the bindings match it:

```powershell
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp.git addons/pure_doom/godot-cpp
& 'C:\Godot\godot.exe' --headless --dump-extension-api      # writes extension_api.json
cd addons/pure_doom
scons platform=windows target=template_debug custom_api_file=..\..\extension_api.json
scons platform=windows target=template_release custom_api_file=..\..\extension_api.json
scons platform=web threads=no target=template_release custom_api_file=..\..\extension_api.json
```

On macOS the same steps with `brew install scons` and the Xcode Command Line Tools produce a universal
(arm64 and x86_64) framework:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp.git addons/pure_doom/godot-cpp
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --headless --dump-extension-api   # writes extension_api.json
cd addons/pure_doom
scons platform=macos arch=universal target=template_debug custom_api_file=../../extension_api.json
scons platform=macos arch=universal target=template_release custom_api_file=../../extension_api.json
```

Windows needs Visual Studio 2022 with the C++ workload, Python and SCons. The web build needs the
Emscripten SDK on `PATH` (`emsdk_env`), and the Web export preset needs Extension Support on and Thread
Support off to match the `threads=no` library. Godot's `godot-cpp` `master` branch is used because the
project runs a 4.8 development build.
